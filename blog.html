                The search for companies helped me
                learn that my knowledge could be put into a real job opportunity. It is amazing to see that my talent can be put to use.<br>
                I got motivated and so I can say with certainty that I will apply for a job in those companies in the future.<br>
                I am interested in software engineering as I mentioned many times on this website. This field has been a part of my life for a long time now, so my goal is to stay motivated and keep on growing in this direction.<br>
                The research helped me realise my goals and set my priorities straight.<br>

              I am a really organized person as well as strong willed, so when I put my mind to something I complete it.<br>
              Unfortunatelly, I am a perfectionist. It may put an additional pressure, but I can manage it and have good outputs due to it. <br>
              I can turn my traits into opportunities by having an organized working space,
              where I have no option of losing sight of my goal. 
              Due to my earlier mentioned weaknesses, I also enjoy having all of my tasks completed so it allows me to finish them on time. <br>
              My main obstacle during my student life will be managing school and work time at the same time. 
              I am sure that I can create a suitable routine. 
              I earlier mentioned that I am a very organized person which I know will help me achieve this goal

                I have been programming and developing in other IT fields for a few years now.<br>
                For the programming languages I coded in python (one project was with selenium as well), c++ and java sript. I worked with html.<br>
                My experience is in the field of database operations as well. I have used such programs as sql and access.<br>
                It started in school but I also worked on my own projects.

                I really enjoyed feedback day. It is increadible to see a perspective of others and how they differ.
                For example first year students thought that I have too many css files, where as the teachers and older students said it's great.<br>
                Due too the feedback day I know how to improve this project, and that shows me that there is no need to stay in one place.
                There is also no logic behind giving up.<br>
                The lesson learned is to not give up and keep improving.

              During my high school years I made a few project connected with software development which made me interested in that field, so I decided to follow my passion.<br>
              My brother and father are both workin in a field of IT or IT related so it is also a way to connect for us, even when we're far away from each other. <br>
              In process of finding a place to study my condition was to live near the sea. That's how HZ ended up on my list. The dealbreaker was the open day. I attended it here and just fell in love with the place. <br>
              After finishing my studies I am plnning on working in a field of IT, and for my retirement I want to live in texas and have a farm.

              I arrived to Netherlands on 24th of August, and I have loved it so far! <br>
              I already managed to buy my own bike, get in touch with students from my year as well as from the second one. I am really happy to be here to persue my passion for programming.<br>
              Being here has been pretty stressfull so far, but if it was easy everyone would do it. I know that everything will turn out well eventually.<br>
